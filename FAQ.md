#### Which **Sites** are supported by the extension? 
Generally only **HTTPS** sites are supported. This excludes internal pages like `chrome://settings` as well as sites not offering SSL encryption. The latter is rather rare nowadays and usually means that the site is either misconfigured or should not be trusted anyway. Another case are sites which (somehow) disable extensions (content scripts) entirely, e. g. the **Chrome WebStore** (`https://chromewebstore.google.com/`), or explicitly deny microphone access by sending a `Feature-Policy` or `Permissions-Policy` **Response Header** stating so. All of these cases are indicated by a <code class="error_message">Red Status/Error Message</code> in the footer section of the extension popup.
